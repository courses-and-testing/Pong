= Pong

== About

This repository is a version of Pong written in Godot with the only purpose of practicing for the Godot Wild Jam.

== Design

We are going to use the `Scenes` in Godot as objects and follow the Object-Oriented Paradigm for developing this game. For now our three objects will be as follow:

. Main: which will have the background and instancing of the other `scenes`.
. Bar: which will be the bars to the sides that play with the ball.
. Ball: I think we all know what a ball in Pong is...
